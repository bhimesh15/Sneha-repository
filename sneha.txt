Asim.Khan - User has been deactivated as per the request - INC000002054339
Jamie.Herrick - No change because its same as the user Adam Griggs
Pete.McDonald - is a normal user 
Shehzad.Iqbal1- is a normal user.. support groups not assigned to him
Angelo.Manesero - is a normal user
Andrew.Hallam -  is a normal user
Godwin.Ansere-Adjei - Is mapped as same as Adam Griggs



Could you please confirm that all the users listed in the tickets do not any open tickets assigned to them from the support group they need to be removed?

Also, if the users have only one support group access like Service Desk – offshore and Service Ops Business IT – Offshore group, is it fine to make them an end user, because one support group is required for them to be a support staff?
